/// Who the runtime is running on, answered once.
///
/// A UI runtime asking `dart:io` which operating system it is on puts the
/// decision in the wrong layer: the widget and binding code then branches on
/// the host directly, needs a `kIsWeb` guard at every one of those branches,
/// and cannot be told otherwise by the embedder that actually knows. This
/// package already keeps platform powers on the other side of a port
/// (`RuntimeCapabilities`, and the conditional imports behind `speech` and
/// `pdfView`); platform identity belongs there for the same reason.
///
/// So: `dart:io` is read in exactly one file, the web build never compiles it,
/// and everything above reads [name] — including a host that knows better than
/// the process does. A kiosk shell, a remote session, or a test says so with
/// [override].
