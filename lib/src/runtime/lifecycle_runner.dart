/// Runs a definition's lifecycle hooks in the order the spec fixes (§1.5.2,

///
/// One runner, because the alternative is what this replaces: an application,
/// a routed page and an embedded `view` each executed a different subset of
/// the seven hooks, so the same document behaved differently depending on
/// where it was shown, and a page that subscribed in `onReady` streamed when
/// embedded and sat dead when opened on its own. A mount site now says only
/// *when* it mounted; which hooks run, and in what order, is decided here.
///
/// ```
/// mount:    onInit → onMount → onReady
/// unmount:  onUnmount → onDestroy
/// ```
///
/// `onPause` is deliberately absent from the unmount sequence. §1.5.1 defines
/// it as "loses active focus but **is not destroyed**", and it is half of the
/// `(onPause ↔ onResume)*` pair §1.5.2 draws — an instance that fires it and
/// then dies has broken both. It matters because of what an author puts
/// there: save a draft, stop a timer, "pick this up when we come back". Firing
/// it on the way out makes teardown work look like it belongs in `onPause`,
/// where it appears to run and silently starts over every time.
///
/// So a destroyed instance goes straight to `onUnmount` → `onDestroy`, and
/// `onPause`/`onResume` are reached only through [pause] and [resume] — the
/// paths where the instance survives.
///
/// Hooks are awaited in order — §6.8.3 requires `onInit` to complete before
/// `onReady` begins, and `onDestroy` to complete before the runtime releases
/// page-scoped resources. A failing hook is logged and the rest still run
/// (§6.8.3); one bad hook must not strand a subscription or leave a view
/// half-built.
